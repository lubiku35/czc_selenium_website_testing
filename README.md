# Project Introduction

Welcome to my Selenium Website Testing project! In this endeavor, I have undertaken the task of ensuring the quality and reliability of the website https://www.czc.cz/. I have chosen this website as the target for my testing efforts due to its popularity and the diverse functionalities it offers.

Throughout this project, I have conducted a comprehensive range of tests, starting from basic ones like accepting cookies and verifying the page title, and progressing towards more sophisticated scenarios such as user registration, login functionality, and adding products to the cart. By covering various aspects of the website, I aim to identify and address any potential issues, ensuring a seamless and satisfying user experience.

> As a little bonus, I also tried to test a subpage of this website, which operates as a blog at the url [https://www.czc.cz/geek](https://www.czc.cz/geek), subpage 'geek' contains a search form to find articles which was another attractive object to test | see more in [Blog Search Values Test](#blog-search-values-test)

# Selected Technologies

> Java, Selenium, Selenide, Allure, Allure JUnit, Allure Selenide, WebDriverManager, JUnit Jupiter API and JUnit Jupiter Engine, SLF4J Simple

- **Selenium**: A popular open-source framework for automating web browsers.
- **Selenide**: A wrapper framework built on top of Selenium that provides a more concise and expressive syntax for writing UI tests.
- **Allure**: A test reporting framework that generates visually appealing and informative reports.
- **Allure JUnit 5**: The Allure integration for JUnit 5, which allows seamless integration with Allure reporting in JUnit 5 tests.
- **Allure Selenide**: An extension for Allure that captures Selenide-specific logs and integrates them into the Allure reports.
- **WebDriverManager**: A library that automates the management of WebDriver binaries, making it easier to set up and use different web browsers for testing.
- **JUnit Jupiter API and JUnit Jupiter Engine**: The JUnit 5 framework for writing and executing tests.
- **SLF4J Simple**: A simple implementation of the Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) API, which provides basic logging functionality for tests.

To accomplish my testing goals, I have utilized the Selenium framework in combination with the powerful Selenide library. Selenide provides a user-friendly and concise syntax for writing automated tests, allowing me to efficiently interact with web elements, simulate user actions, and validate the expected behaviors of the website.

As part of my testing strategy, I have incorporated the Allure reporting framework, which generates comprehensive and visually appealing reports. With Allure, I can present my test results in a professional manner, providing detailed insights into the test execution, including step-by-step logs, screenshots, and overall test outcomes. This enhances my ability to track and analyze test failures, making it easier to identify and resolve any potential issues.
